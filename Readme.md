# Dogestry

Simple CLI app + server for storing and retrieving Docker image(s) from Amazon S3.

## Prerequisites

* AWS account with at least one S3 bucket
* Go 1.4 or higher (*development only*)
* [github.com/tools/godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) (*development only*)
* Docker 1.4 or higher

## Installation

If you just want to *run* Dogestry, get the [binary release](https://github.com/dogestry/dogestry/releases) that works for your platform. It's a statically linked binary: there are no dependencies. Download and run it!

If you prefer to build it yourself, clone the repo and `godep get && godep go build`

## Usage

### Setup

Typical S3 Usage:
```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABC
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=DEF
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375
$ dogestry push s3://<bucket name>?region=us-east-1 <image name>
$ dogestry pull s3://<bucket name>?region=us-east-1 <image name>
```

### Push

Push the `hipache` image to the S3 bucket `ops-goodies` located in `us-west-2`:
```
dogestry push s3://ops-goodies/ hipache
```

Push the `hipache` image to the S3 bucket `ops-goodies` located in `us-west-2` with tag `latest`:
```
dogestry push s3://ops-goodies/ hipache:latest
```

### Pull

Pull the `hipache` image and tag from S3 bucket `ops-goodies`:
```
dogestry pull s3://ops-goodies/ hipache
```

Pull the `hipache` image and tag from S3 bucket `ops-goodies` with tag `latest`:
```
dogestry pull s3://ops-goodies/ hipache:latest
```

If you want to pull an image from S3 to multiple hosts, you can use the `-pullhosts` option.
The value for the `-pullhosts` option is a comma-separated list of hosts, in the following
format: `tcp://[host][:port]` or `unix://path`.

The s3 version, with pullhosts:

```
dogestry -pullhosts tcp://host-1:2375,tcp://host-2:2375,tcp://host-3:2375 s3://ops-goodies/docker-repo/ hipache
```

### List

List the images in the S3 bucket `ops-goodies`:
```
$ dogestry list s3://ops-goodies/
REPOSITORY                                                    TAG
hipache                                                       0.3.1
hipache                                                       latest
hipache                                                       0.2.8
hipache                                                       0.2.4
```

### Server Mode (Accelerator)
Dogestry can also be run in server mode with the `-server` parameter; doing so can **dramatically** speed up image pulls when using `-pullhosts`. It also directly supports pulls from the `docker` client itself.

To make use of server mode:

1. Deploy and run Dogestry with the `-server` param on all Docker servers that are the destinations of the '-pullhosts' parameter. This can be done directly, or inside a container with access to the `docker.sock`.
2. Ensure your firewall on the host(s) is configured to allow incoming requests on port *22375* (this is what dogestry server listens on by default). Map this port if running it in a container.
3. Perform your `pull` (with `-pullhosts`) as usual:
  ```
  $ dogestry -pullhosts tcp://host-1:2375,tcp://host-2:2375,tcp://host-3:2375 s3://ops-goodies/docker-repo/ hipache
  ```

Dogestry (client) will automatically detect that the remote host is running Dogestry server and issue the pull command directly to the host (instead of pulling the image down first and then uploading it to the host via Docker API).

In addition, you can also perform a `pull` against a server running Dogestry, avoiding the need for the `dogestry` binary:

```
# Update your .dockercfg to include your AWS credentials
$ dogestry login opsgoodies.com
Updating docker file /root/.dockercfg...
AWS_ACCESS_KEY: MyAwsAccessKey
AWS_SECRET_KEY: MyAWSSecretKey
S3_URL: s3://ops-goodies
# You can now pull via the Docker binary
$ docker -H tcp://host-1:22375 pull opsgoodies.com/docker-repo/hipache
```

## S3 files layout

Dogestry will create two directories within your S3 bucket called "images" and "repositories". Example contents:

Images:
```
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/layer.tar
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/VERSION
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/json
```

Repositories:
```
repositories/myapp/20131210     (content: 5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f)
repositories/myapp/latest       (content: 5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f)
```
