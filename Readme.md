# Dogestry

Simple CLI app for storing Docker image on Amazon S3.

## Prerequisites

* AWS account with at least one S3 bucket
* Go 1.4 or higher (*development only*)
* [github.com/tools/godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) (*development only*)
* Docker 1.4 or higher

## Installation

If you just want to *run* Dogestry, get the [binary release](https://github.com/dogestry/dogestry/releases) that works for your platform. It's a statically linked binary: there are no dependencies. Uncompress it and run it!

If you prefer to build it yourself, clone the repo and `godep go build`

## Usage

### Setup

Typical S3 Usage:
```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ABC
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=DEF
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375
$ dogestry push s3://<bucket name>/<path name>/?region=us-east-1 <image name>
$ dogestry pull s3://<bucket name>/<path name>/?region=us-east-1 <image name>
```

Dogestry can run without a configuration file (example config `dogestry.eg.cfg`), but it's there if you need it.

By default dogestry looks for config file in `./dogestry.cfg`.

### Push

Push the `hipache` image to the S3 bucket `ops-goodies` located in `us-west-2`:
```
dogestry push s3://ops-goodies/ hipache
```

Push the `hipache` image to the S3 bucket `ops-goodies` located in `us-west-2` with tag `latest`:
```
dogestry push s3://ops-goodies/ hipache:latest
```

### Pull

Pull the `hipache` image and tag from S3 bucket `ops-goodies`:
```
dogestry pull s3://ops-goodies/ hipache
```

Pull the `hipache` image and tag from S3 bucket `ops-goodies` with tag `latest`:
```
dogestry pull s3://ops-goodies/ hipache:latest
```

If you want to pull an image from S3 to multiple hosts, you can use the `-pullhosts` option.
The value for the `-pullhosts` option is a comma-separated list of hosts, in the following
format: `tcp://[host][:port]` or `unix://path`.

The s3 version, with pullhosts:

```
dogestry -pullhosts tcp://host-1:2375,tcp://host-2:2375,tcp://host-3:2375 s3://ops-goodies/docker-repo/ hipache
```

## S3 files layout

Dogestry will create two directories within your S3 bucket called "images" and "repositories". Example contents:

Images:
```
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/layer.tar
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/VERSION
images/5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f/json
```

Repositories:
```
repositories/myapp/20131210     (content: 5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f)
repositories/myapp/latest       (content: 5d4e24b3d968cc6413a81f6f49566a0db80be401d647ade6d977a9dd9864569f)
